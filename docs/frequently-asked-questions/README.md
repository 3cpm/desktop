# Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I update?

### Why did we go with a downloadable application?

I know, quite a few people might be up in arms about requiring a download on their computer to use this. It was ultimately a tough decision but one that I hope you agree made sense. There were a few considerations:

1. Cost. Running an application through a website is not cheap, requires a lot of work to maintain, and is difficult to scale for a small project.
2. Data storage / security. Building a website requires storing your API keys, transaction data, managing cookies, logins, and more on a database that you have to trust us to keep secure. I don't need that on my conscience right now. Having a local app means that your data is as secure as you keep your computer. It's stored with normal application files, encrypted when necessary, and about as isolated from the world as a database can get. This also means that you're fully in control of your data at all times.

### Why should I trust this?

Well, for starters you shouldn't; At least, not right away. Every time you try something new you should ask yourself a few questions. \(Let's do another list!\).

#### 1. Who are these people?

Right away you can see that this is my real profile with all my real information tied to it. I have a small but important reputation to uphold. A quick google search will show you more than I care to see about myself. Anyone who works on this project has to go through me before getting their code approved for the project. So, at a bare minimum, you have that level of trust.

#### 2. What would they gain from my data?

We have reduced the need for data altogether in this project. The keys are **read-only**, do not send you data off anywhere, and quite frankly transactional data history is boring.

#### 3. It's open-source, so you can review the code and even compile it yourself!

You can search through the code for anything you want to find, it's all available to you. Many people have used this, ran it through virus scanners and the works. At the end of the day I'm building this for myself but the community benefits as well.

### Unsafe File Warning

If you are downloading this for the first time you may get an `Unsafe file warning` within Edge / Chrome / Firefox. This is because the file is currently an unsigned download. Code Signing costs money and takes time. Unfortunately, this project has not reached that point yet.

How can you help? 

1. Consider buying a coffee to support the project. If we can raise enough we can look into getting a code signing certificate. They run about $300 - $600 / yr. [You can buy a coffee here!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ColtonS) 

2. Flag the file as safe once you've downloaded this. The more reports we get the less it'll happen!

* Edge: Click the three dots &gt; `report this file as safe`. 

If you still feel unsafe downloading this file you can download the source code and compile it yourself, or run it through any virus scanner.
