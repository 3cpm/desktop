### Why does my profit or bankroll not match 3Commas?

Usually, this has to do with filters. Within the 3C Portfolio Manager you're able to decide what accounts, currencies, and start dates for your data. This means there is the possibility you're filtering out data that would be shown on 3Commas. By default 3Commas will display 100% of your accounts and funds.

You can adjust your filters within the 3C Portfolio Manager settings.
